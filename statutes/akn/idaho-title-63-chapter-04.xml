                <akn:p>, Idaho Code, the state tax commission shall determine the amount of such tax to be apportioned to each county separately in proportion to the property tax levied by all eligible taxing districts and units and amounts allocated to each urban renewal agency statewide in tax year 2025 on the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies. The 2025 property tax amounts levied or allocated shall be certified by each county auditor to the state tax commission no later than January 12, 2026. The state tax commission shall calculate proportions by dividing the total amount so reported for each county by the sum of all such amounts for all eligible taxing districts and units and urban renewal agencies statewide. Taxing districts, units, and urban renewal agencies are eligible for a proportion of this tax and are included in the calculation of these proportions, provided they levied property tax against the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies or received an allocation of property tax paid by such companies for tax year 2025. In the event that a taxing district or unit or urban renewal revenue allocation area dissolves or is no longer present in a county, or a voter approved bond expires, the proportions for each taxing district in each affected county shall be changed as follows:</akn:p>

                <akn:p>, Idaho Code, the state tax commission shall determine the amount of such tax to be apportioned to each county separately in proportion to the property tax levied by all eligible taxing districts and units and amounts allocated to each urban renewal agency statewide in tax year 2025 on the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies. The 2025 property tax amounts levied or allocated shall be certified by each county auditor to the state tax commission no later than January 12, 2026. The state tax commission shall calculate proportions by dividing the total amount so reported for each county by the sum of all such amounts for all eligible taxing districts and units and urban renewal agencies statewide. Taxing districts, units, and urban renewal agencies are eligible for a proportion of this tax and are included in the calculation of these proportions, provided they levied property tax against the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies or received an allocation of property tax paid by such companies for tax year 2025. In the event that a taxing district or unit or urban renewal revenue allocation area dissolves or is no longer present in a county, or a voter approved bond expires, the proportions for each taxing district in each affected county shall be changed as follows:</akn:p>

                <akn:p>, Idaho Code, the state tax commission shall determine the amount of such tax to be apportioned to each county separately in proportion to the property tax levied by all eligible taxing districts and units and amounts allocated to each urban renewal agency statewide in tax year 2025 on the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies. The 2025 property tax amounts levied or allocated shall be certified by each county auditor to the state tax commission no later than January 12, 2026. The state tax commission shall calculate proportions by dividing the total amount so reported for each county by the sum of all such amounts for all eligible taxing districts and units and urban renewal agencies statewide. Taxing districts, units, and urban renewal agencies are eligible for a proportion of this tax and are included in the calculation of these proportions, provided they levied property tax against the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies or received an allocation of property tax paid by such companies for tax year 2025. In the event that a taxing district or unit or urban renewal revenue allocation area dissolves or is no longer present in a county, or a voter approved bond expires, the proportions for each taxing district in each affected county shall be changed as follows:</akn:p>

The 2025 property tax amounts levied or allocated shall be certified by each county auditor to the state tax commission no later than January 12, 2026. The state tax commission shall calculate proportions by dividing the total amount so reported for each county by the sum of all such amounts for all eligible taxing districts and units and urban renewal agencies statewide. Taxing districts, units, and urban renewal agencies are eligible for a proportion of this tax and are included in the calculation of these proportions, provided they levied property tax against the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies or received an allocation of property tax paid by such companies for tax year 2025. In the event that a taxing district or unit or urban renewal revenue allocation area dissolves or is no longer present in a county, or a voter approved bond expires, the proportions for each taxing district in each affected county shall be changed as follows:</akn:p>

                <akn:p>, Idaho Code, the state tax commission shall determine the amount of such tax to be apportioned to each county separately in proportion to the property tax levied by all eligible taxing districts and units and amounts allocated to each urban renewal agency statewide in tax year 2025 on the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies. The 2025 property tax amounts levied or allocated shall be certified by each county auditor to the state tax commission no later than January 12, 2026. The state tax commission shall calculate proportions by dividing the total amount so reported for each county by the sum of all such amounts for all eligible taxing districts and units and urban renewal agencies statewide. Taxing districts, units, and urban renewal agencies are eligible for a proportion of this tax and are included in the calculation of these proportions, provided they levied property tax against the operating property of rate-regulated electric utility companies, rate-regulated affiliated gas companies, and rate-regulated gas companies or received an allocation of property tax paid by such companies for tax year 2025. In the event that a taxing district or unit or urban renewal revenue allocation area dissolves or is no longer present in a county, or a voter approved bond expires, the proportions for each taxing district in each affected county shall be changed as follows:</akn:p>
