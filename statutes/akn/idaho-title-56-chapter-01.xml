              <akn:p>"Goodwill" means the amount paid by the purchaser that exceeds the net tangible assets received. The value of goodwill is derived from the economic benefits that a going concern may enjoy, as compared with a new one, from established relations in the related markets, with government departments and other noncommercial bodies and with personal relationships. These intangible assets cannot be separated from the business and sold as can plant and equipment. Under the theory that the excess payment would be made only if expected future earnings justified it, goodwill is often described as the price paid for excess future earnings. The amortization of goodwill is nonallowable, nonreimbursable expense.</akn:p>

The value of goodwill is derived from the economic benefits that a going concern may enjoy, as compared with a new one, from established relations in the related markets, with government departments and other noncommercial bodies and with personal relationships. These intangible assets cannot be separated from the business and sold as can plant and equipment. Under the theory that the excess payment would be made only if expected future earnings justified it, goodwill is often described as the price paid for excess future earnings. The amortization of goodwill is nonallowable, nonreimbursable expense.</akn:p>

The value of goodwill is derived from the economic benefits that a going concern may enjoy, as compared with a new one, from established relations in the related markets, with government departments and other noncommercial bodies and with personal relationships. These intangible assets cannot be separated from the business and sold as can plant and equipment. Under the theory that the excess payment would be made only if expected future earnings justified it, goodwill is often described as the price paid for excess future earnings.
