Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not service animals for purposes of this chapter. The work or tasks performed by the service dog must be directly related to the individual’s disability. Examples of work or tasks include, but are not limited to, assisting individuals who are blind or have low vision with navigation and other tasks, alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to the presence of people or sounds, providing nonviolent protection or rescue work, pulling a wheelchair, assisting an individual during a seizure, alerting individuals to the presence of allergens, retrieving items such as medicine or the telephone, providing physical support and assistance with balance and stability to individuals with mobility disabilities, and helping persons with psychiatric and neurological disabilities by preventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors. The crime deterrent effects of an animal’s presence and the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship do not constitute work or tasks for the purposes of this chapter.

              <akn:p>Findings and intent. The federal achieving a better life experience (ABLE) act, public law 113-295, 26 U.S.C. 529A, provides that a state may establish a program under which certain individuals with disabilities may open accounts in order to save money to pay for qualified disability expenses, such as expenses relating to education, housing, transportation, employment training and assistive technology. These accounts may be opened by qualified Idahoans in any state having an ABLE account program and are to be disregarded when determining an individual’s eligibility for assistance programs established by federal law, including medicaid and supplemental security income. The legislature finds that ABLE accounts promote dignified personal independence and opportunities for individuals with disabilities. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to: (a)  Create an Idaho ABLE account program by allowing the Idaho state treasurer to enter into an agreement with a national consortium of ABLE accounts; (b)  Protect the eligibility of individuals who have an ABLE account when applying for state or local assistance; and (c)  Provide technical assistance to Idahoans interested in opening an Idaho ABLE account.</akn:p>

              <akn:p>Findings and intent. The federal achieving a better life experience (ABLE) act, public law 113-295, 26 U.S.C. 529A, provides that a state may establish a program under which certain individuals with disabilities may open accounts in order to save money to pay for qualified disability expenses, such as expenses relating to education, housing, transportation, employment training and assistive technology. These accounts may be opened by qualified Idahoans in any state having an ABLE account program and are to be disregarded when determining an individual’s eligibility for assistance programs established by federal law, including medicaid and supplemental security income. The legislature finds that ABLE accounts promote dignified personal independence and opportunities for individuals with disabilities. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to: (a)  Create an Idaho ABLE account program by allowing the Idaho state treasurer to enter into an agreement with a national consortium of ABLE accounts; (b)  Protect the eligibility of individuals who have an ABLE account when applying for state or local assistance; and (c)  Provide technical assistance to Idahoans interested in opening an Idaho ABLE account.</akn:p>
