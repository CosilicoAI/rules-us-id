              <akn:p>The term "sales price" means the total amount for which tangible personal property, including services agreed to be rendered as a part of the sale, is sold, rented or leased, valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, without any deduction on account of any of the following: 1.  The cost of the property sold. However, in accordance with such rules as the state tax commission may prescribe, a deduction may be taken if the retailer has purchased property for some purpose other than resale or rental, has reimbursed his vendor for tax which the vendor is required to pay to the state or has paid the use tax with respect to the property, and has resold or rented the property prior to making any use of the property other than retention, demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular course of business. If such a deduction is taken by the retailer, no refund or credit will be allowed to his vendor with respect to the sale of the property. 2.  The cost of materials used, labor or service cost, losses, or any other expense. 3.  The cost of transportation of the property prior to its sale. 4.  The face value of manufacturer’s discount coupons. A manufacturer’s discount coupon is a price reduction coupon presented by a consumer to a retailer upon purchase of a manufacturer’s product, the face value of which may only be reimbursed by the manufacturer to the retailer.</akn:p>

              <akn:p>The term "sales price" means the total amount for which tangible personal property, including services agreed to be rendered as a part of the sale, is sold, rented or leased, valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, without any deduction on account of any of the following: 1.  The cost of the property sold. However, in accordance with such rules as the state tax commission may prescribe, a deduction may be taken if the retailer has purchased property for some purpose other than resale or rental, has reimbursed his vendor for tax which the vendor is required to pay to the state or has paid the use tax with respect to the property, and has resold or rented the property prior to making any use of the property other than retention, demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular course of business. If such a deduction is taken by the retailer, no refund or credit will be allowed to his vendor with respect to the sale of the property. 2.  The cost of materials used, labor or service cost, losses, or any other expense. 3.  The cost of transportation of the property prior to its sale. 4.  The face value of manufacturer’s discount coupons. A manufacturer’s discount coupon is a price reduction coupon presented by a consumer to a retailer upon purchase of a manufacturer’s product, the face value of which may only be reimbursed by the manufacturer to the retailer.</akn:p>

The burden of proving the sale is tax-exempt is on the person who makes the sale, unless he obtains from the purchaser a resale certificate to the effect that the property is purchased for resale or rental. It shall be presumed that sales made to a person who has completed a resale certificate for the seller’s records are not taxable and the seller need not collect sales or use taxes unless the tangible personal property purchased is taxable to the purchaser as a matter of law in the particular instance claimed on the resale certificate. (a)  A seller may accept a resale certificate from a purchaser prior to the time of sale, at the time of sale, or at any reasonable time after the sale when necessary to establish the privilege of the exemption. The resale certificate relieves the person selling the property from the burden of proof only if taken from a person who is engaged in the business of selling or renting tangible personal property and who holds the permit provided for by section 63-3620 , Idaho Code, or who is a retailer not engaged in business in this state and who, at the time of purchasing the tangible personal property, intends to sell or rent it in the regular course of business or is unable to ascertain at the time of purchase whether the property will be sold or used for some other purpose. Other than as provided elsewhere in this section, when a resale certificate, properly executed, is presented to the seller, the seller has no duty or obligation to collect sales or use taxes in regard to any sales transaction so documented, regardless of whether the purchaser properly or improperly claimed an exemption.

Other than as provided elsewhere in this section, when a resale certificate, properly executed, is presented to the seller, the seller has no duty or obligation to collect sales or use taxes in regard to any sales transaction so documented, regardless of whether the purchaser properly or improperly claimed an exemption.

The burden of proving the sale is tax-exempt is on the person who makes the sale, unless he obtains from the purchaser a resale certificate to the effect that the property is purchased for resale or rental. It shall be presumed that sales made to a person who has completed a resale certificate for the seller’s records are not taxable and the seller need not collect sales or use taxes unless the tangible personal property purchased is taxable to the purchaser as a matter of law in the particular instance claimed on the resale certificate. (a)  A seller may accept a resale certificate from a purchaser prior to the time of sale, at the time of sale, or at any reasonable time after the sale when necessary to establish the privilege of the exemption. The resale certificate relieves the person selling the property from the burden of proof only if taken from a person who is engaged in the business of selling or renting tangible personal property and who holds the permit provided for by section 63-3620 , Idaho Code, or who is a retailer not engaged in business in this state and who, at the time of purchasing the tangible personal property, intends to sell or rent it in the regular course of business or is unable to ascertain at the time of purchase whether the property will be sold or used for some other purpose. Other than as provided elsewhere in this section, when a resale certificate, properly executed, is presented to the seller, the seller has no duty or obligation to collect sales or use taxes in regard to any sales transaction so documented, regardless of whether the purchaser properly or improperly claimed an exemption.

Fair rental value is the amount for which the same or similar property could be leased or rented by the taxpayer from another, unrelated person in the business of leasing or renting such equipment for profit.

The election need not be filed with the state tax commission but must be reflected in the records supporting the computation of the tax shown to be due on the return. After the due date of the first tax return on which the use tax is due, an election may only be made with the written approval of the state tax commission.

Fair rental value is the amount for which the same or similar property could be leased or rented by the taxpayer from another, unrelated person in the business of leasing or renting such equipment for profit. A taxpayer electing to pay use tax on the fair rental value must establish the value by clear and convincing evidence. Any allowable credit for sales or use taxes paid to another state shall be first exhausted before any tax becomes due under this section. (c)  If transient equipment taxed upon its fair rental value ceases to qualify as transient equipment, it shall be taxed as provided in section 63-3621 , Idaho Code, based upon the value at the time the equipment ceased to qualify. (d)  A taxpayer may elect to pay tax on the fair rental value on or before the due date of the first tax return on which the use tax is due. The election need not be filed with the state tax commission but must be reflected in the records supporting the computation of the tax shown to be due on the return. After the due date of the first tax return on which the use tax is due, an election may only be made with the written approval of the state tax commission. The commission shall grant approval only upon evidence establishing that at the time the equipment first became subject to use tax in this state, the taxpayer intended a use for the equipment which would have qualified the property as transient equipment. (e)  Upon discovery of property subject to use tax in this state in regard to which no use tax has been reported, the state tax commission may assert use tax in the manner provided in section 63-3629 , Idaho Code, based upon the fair rental value if the commission finds that at the time the equipment first became subject to use tax in this state, the taxpayer intended a use for the equipment which would have qualified the property as transient equipment.
