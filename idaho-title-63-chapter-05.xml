A preponderance of the evidence shall suffice to sustain the burden of proof. The burden of proof shall fall upon the party seeking affirmative relief and the burden of going forward with the evidence shall shift as in other civil litigation.

Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to suspend the payment of property taxes pending said appeal.</akn:p>

              <akn:p>In any appeal taken to the board of tax appeals or the district court pursuant to this section, the burden of proof shall fall upon the party seeking affirmative relief to establish that the valuation from which the appeal is taken is erroneous, or that the board of equalization erred in its decision regarding a claim that certain property is exempt from taxation, the value thereof, or any other relief sought before the board of equalization; provided, however, that the burden of proof shall fall upon the party seeking an increase in taxable value if the increase in value exceeds ten percent (10%) of the value from the previous year, and the increase was due in part to an assessment of the taxable value that resulted from the assessor failing to use the equalization methods required pursuant to section 63-208 , Idaho Code. A preponderance of the evidence shall suffice to sustain the burden of proof. The burden of going forward with the evidence shall shift as in other civil litigation. The board of tax appeals or the district court shall render its decision in writing, including therein a concise statement of the facts found by the court and the conclusions of law reached by the court. The board of tax appeals or the court may affirm, reverse, modify or remand any order of the board of equalization, and shall grant other relief, invoke such other remedies, and issue such orders in accordance with its decision, as appropriate.</akn:p>
